# üîç What is VPunks?

VPunks OG is a non-fungible token (NFT) consisting of 10,000 unique 24x24 pixel images generated by an algorithm, each featuring a punk-style male or female character with random attributes. Although some attributes may overlap, no two NFTs are exactly alike. Additionally, rare attributes such as Apes, Zombies, and Aliens add to the colorful and unique world of NFTs.

Using Vechain's blockchain, VPunks quickly sold out of its limited 10,000 NFTs within 8 days. We integrate gaming and tokenization offering staking and liquidity pools with rewards in VPU (VPunks native token) in return for supporting the ecosystem. It‚Äôs a cross between NFTs and DeFi, with gamification as the underlying business model.

VPunks is created using the VIP-181 smart contract standard on VeChain (similar to Ethereum's ERC-721 standard). You can read more about the VIP-181 standard here: [VIP-181](https://vechaininsider.com/vechain/an-overview-of-the-vechain-improvement-proposals-vip/).
