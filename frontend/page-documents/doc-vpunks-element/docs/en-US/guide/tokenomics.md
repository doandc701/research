### Community Treasury

With \~4.13% of tokens already available to be claimed by users who have minted VPunks, the governance treasury will retain \~49.87% \[60,340,000 VPU] of VPU supply to distribute on liquidity mining, staking, and other programs.

Product development team and community management team VPU allocations will have tokens locked up on an identical schedule.

### **VPU use case**

#### Staking

Users will be able to lock up their tokens to VPunks and receive rewards.

VPU staking acts as an incentive for holding VPU and supporting the ecosystem. Stakers receive VPU. Stakers will eventually direct usage of The Community Treasury.

#### Liquidity Mining

The initial liquidity mining program will work after the initial liquidity pool is launched: VPU/VET&#x20;

These $VPUs aren't subject to vesting or lock up.

#### Payment

VPU will be accepted as currency within the VPunks marketplace. VPU may also be used to determine eligibility for participation in certain sales/auctions conducted by the VPunks team.

### Games

VPunks continues to evolve alongside the blockchain gaming industry to offer you a diverse range of game modes, such as PVP auto-battle tournaments you can play in your browser and participate in P2E battles. This is just the beginning.
