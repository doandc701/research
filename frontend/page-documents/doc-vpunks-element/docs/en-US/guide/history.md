# ðŸ“ˆ History

The VPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, 24x24 pixel algorithmically generated images. VPunksâ€™ NFTs are stored on the VeChainThor Blockchain.&#x20;

The initial minting stage began on July 25, 2021 (required the VeChainThor token, $VET).&#x20;

The price to mint a VPunk increased with every 1,000 VPunks minted, starting at 390 VET for VPunks numbered 0â€“999 and ending at 3,900 VET for VPunks 9,000â€“9,999. The 10,000th, and final, VPunk was minted on August 5, 2021.

The VPunks community launched a Telegram chat room on July 30, 2021. The chatroom has been used by the community to make announcements and as a place for members to discuss the project. As of September 6, 2021, the Telegram group had grown to 1,616 members.

Subsequently, on August 4th, 2021, the community members created a VPunks Discord server. The Admin officially took over the discord server on August 17th, 2021, and we have continued to develop this community until now.
