## üîç What is VPunks?

VPunks OG is a non-fungible token (NFT) consisting of 10,000 unique 24x24 pixel images generated by an algorithm, each featuring a punk-style male or female character with random attributes. Although some attributes may overlap, no two NFTs are exactly alike. Additionally, rare attributes such as Apes, Zombies, and Aliens add to the colorful and unique world of NFTs.

Using Vechain's blockchain, VPunks quickly sold out of its limited 10,000 NFTs within 8 days. We integrate gaming and tokenization offering staking and liquidity pools with rewards in VPU (VPunks native token) in return for supporting the ecosystem. It‚Äôs a cross between NFTs and DeFi, with gamification as the underlying business model.

VPunks is created using the VIP-181 smart contract standard on VeChain (similar to Ethereum's ERC-721 standard). You can read more about the VIP-181 standard here: [VIP-181](https://vechaininsider.com/vechain/an-overview-of-the-vechain-improvement-proposals-vip/).

## üìà History

The VPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique, 24x24 pixel algorithmically generated images. VPunks‚Äô NFTs are stored on the VeChainThor Blockchain.&#x20;

The initial minting stage began on July 25, 2021 (required the VeChainThor token, $VET).&#x20;

The price to mint a VPunk increased with every 1,000 VPunks minted, starting at 390 VET for VPunks numbered 0‚Äì999 and ending at 3,900 VET for VPunks 9,000‚Äì9,999. The 10,000th, and final, VPunk was minted on August 5, 2021.

The VPunks community launched a Telegram chat room on July 30, 2021. The chatroom has been used by the community to make announcements and as a place for members to discuss the project. As of September 6, 2021, the Telegram group had grown to 1,616 members.

Subsequently, on August 4th, 2021, the community members created a VPunks Discord server. The Admin officially took over the discord server on August 17th, 2021, and we have continued to develop this community until now.
