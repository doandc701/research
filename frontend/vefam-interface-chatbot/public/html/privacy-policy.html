  <p class="title">3. Blockchain Technology and Your Data</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>NFT.</b> Blockchain is at the core of the Services that Sorare provides.
      This technology in the form of non-fungible-tokens (NFT) creates the verifiable authenticity, scarcity, and interoperability of your Collectibles.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Layer 2 and ZKP.</b> To provide you with the best experience, Sorare has partnered with Starkware to further build on the Ethereum public blockchain with Zero Knowledge Proof (“ZKP”) technology.
      This infrastructure allows Sorare to benefit from a Layer 2on top of the Layer 1 Ethereum public blockchain.
      This Layer 2 employs a ZKP data rollup which processes transaction data, updates the Layer 2 state and then offloads the compressed Layer 2 state to the Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain for reference.
      From a data protection perspective, the rollup generates cryptographic receipts that confirm the authenticity of transaction data without publishing or storing Personal Data about the transaction participants on the Layer 1 Ethereum public blockchain.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Your data.</b> Your wallet public key and the information related to your purchases, transfers, withdrawals, and exchanges of Collectibles are stored on our AWS servers, by Starkware who provides the Layer 2 described above and our data availability committee whose members ensure the back-up of this information and are committed to strict confidentiality obligations.
      No Personal Data of our Users is stored by Sorare on the public Ethereum blockchain.
      However, please note that if you withdraw your funds or a Collectible from your Wallet (for instance to transfer them to another service or to an external wallet), such transfer will involve the storage of the information related to this transfer on a public blockchain.
      All transfers to external wallets are subject to the relevant Third-Party Service’s privacy policy and/or terms of service, please make sure to review the privacy policies and practices of the third parties involved before you proceed with such transfer.
      As indicated in our terms and conditions Sorare will not be held liable for any third-party content or service and disclaims all responsibility for any and all services provided to a User by a third-party service provider.
