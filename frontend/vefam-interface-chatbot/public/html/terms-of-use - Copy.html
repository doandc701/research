<p class="update-time">LAST UPDATED: 2022.10.05</p>
<div class="categories">
  <p class="title">1. Introduction</p>
  <div class="line">
    Welcome to VeFam (“VeFam,” “we,” “us”, or “our”).
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the VeFam website(s), our APIs, mobile app (the “App”), and any other software, tools, features, or functionalities provided on or in connection with our services; including without limitation using our services to view, explore, and create NFTs and use our tools, at your own discretion, to connect directly with others to purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public blockchains (collectively, the “Service”).
    “NFT” in these Terms means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum, Vechain, Binance, Solana blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    For purposes of these Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your” means you as the user of the Service.
    If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
    AS OUTLINED IN SECTION <span style="color:brown">-----16</span> BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WHICH (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY A JUDGE OR JURY IN COURT.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    By accessing or continuing to use our website and related services, you agree to abide by these terms and conditions, including our Privacy Policy.
    If you do not agree with any of these terms, or the terms of our privacy policy you should cease using our website.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    VeFam is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, money services business, or creditor.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    VeFam is not party to any agreement between any users.
    You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers using the Service and we make no claims about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or NFTs (and any content associated with such NFTs) visible on the Service.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific services (and such services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms).
    Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant service, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services.
    In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall control for that specific service.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    VeFam reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion.
    If we make material changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms.
    By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated.
    It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.

    Accordingly, any persons who access the Site and/or the App while breaking their local laws are doing it on their own initiative and will have to deal with the consequences when applicable.
  </div>
  <div class="line">

<div class="categories">
  <p class="title">2. Definitions</p>
  <div class="line">In these Terms:</div>
    <b>"Non-fungible token" "NFT":</b> means Ethereum-based tokens complying with the ERC-721 standard, ERC-1155 standard or other similar “non-fungible” token standards (eg: VIP-181, VIP-210 on Vechain).
    NFTs are intended to be “non-fungible” tokens representing a unique Collectible; however, certain NFTs may be fungible with one another (i.e., all such NFTs are associated with the same Collectible Metadata) while being non-fungible with other NFTs (i.e., such NFTs are associated with different Collectible Metadata).
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <b>"Fungible items":</b> can be exchanged because their value defines them rather than their unique properties.
    For example, BTC or dollars are fungible because 0.01 BTC / $1 USD is exchangeable for another 0.01 BTC / $1 USD.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="categories">
  <p class="title">3. Accessing the Service</p>
  <div class="line">
    <b>"VeFam C-Account":</b> is a registered user account, stored on VeFam server, used to log in to online games and other services.
    Your C-Account will be associated with your linked blockchain address.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    <b>"VeFam D-Account":</b> is a VIP account user registers on blockchain via smart contract, user uses VIP account to refer friends and participate in some of our discount programs.
  </div>
  <div class="line">

    Accordingly, you will need a blockchain address and a third-party wallet to access the Service.
    Your account on the service (“Account”, including C-Account and D-Account) will be associated with your blockchain address; however, if you want to add some flair to your VeFam persona, you can add additional information, such as a profile picture, to your Account.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    Your Account on VeFam will be associated with your linked blockchain address and display the NFTs for that blockchain address (and, if applicable, any content associated with such NFTs).
    By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet.
    Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with VeFam, and VeFam does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents.
    VeFam accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Service will operate with any specific wallet.

    You further covenant that the foregoing shall be true during the entire period of this agreement.
    If you access or use the Service outside the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the Service in such country, territory or jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    VeFam may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms.
    In such cases, VeFam, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account and block your ability to access the Service until such additional information and documents are processed by VeFam.

  </div>
  <div class="line">
    We require all users to be at least 18 years old.
    If you are at least 13 years old but under 18 years old, you may only use VeFam through a parent or guardian’s Account and with their approval and oversight.

  <p class="title">6. Third-Party Content and Services</p>
  <div class="line">
    As a peer-to-peer web3 service, VeFam helps you explore NFTs created by third parties and interact with different blockchains.
    VeFam does not make any representations or warranties about this third-party content visible through our Service, including any content associated with NFTs displayed on the Service, and you bear responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers.
    We also cannot guarantee that any NFTs visible on VeFam will always remain visible and/or available to be bought, sold, or transferred.
  </div>
  <div class="line">
    NFTs may be subject to terms directly between buyers and sellers with respect to the use of the NFT content and benefits associated with a given NFT (“Purchase Terms”).
    For example, when you click to get more details about any of the NFTs visible on VeFam, you may notice a third party link to the creator’s website.
    Such website may include Purchase Terms governing the use of the NFT that you will be required to comply with.
    VeFam is not a party to any such Purchase Terms, which are solely between the buyer and the seller.
    The buyer and seller are entirely responsible for communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing Purchase Terms.
    You are solely responsible for reviewing such Purchase Terms.

    The Service may also contain links or functionality to access or use third-party websites (“Third-Party Websites”) and applications (“Third-Party Applications”), or otherwise display, include, or make available content, data, information, services, applications, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”).
    When you click on a link to, or access and use, a Third-Party Website or Third-Party Application, though we may not warn you that you have left our Service, you are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website or destination.
    Such Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials are not under the control of VeFam, and may be “open” applications for which no recourse is possible.
    VeFam is not responsible or liable for any Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials.
    VeFam provides links to these Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Applications only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Websites or Third-Party Applications, or their products or services or associated Third-Party Materials.

  <p class="title">11. Assumption of Risk</p>
  <div class="line">
    You accept and acknowledge:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The value of an NFTs is subjective.
        Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices.
        You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.
      </li>
      <li>
        A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of NFTs.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.
        VeFam is not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting the taxes that apply to your NFTs.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable.
        You represent and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains.
        Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and VeFam has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account.
        You accept and acknowledge that VeFam will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network, however caused.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors.
        If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.
      </li>
      <li>
        VeFam reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by other issues.
        Items you purchase may become inaccessible on VeFam.
        Under no circumstances shall the inability to view items on VeFam or an inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against VeFam.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have a dispute with one or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.
        IN ENTERING INTO THIS RELEASE YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY PROTECTIONS (WHETHER STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF THIS RELEASE TO INCLUDE THOSE CLAIMS WHICH YOU MAY KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN YOUR FAVOR AT THE TIME OF AGREEING TO THIS RELEASE.

  <p class="title">12. Collectibles</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Collectibles:</b> Collectibles are unique digital trading cards featuring a professional athlete with a non-fungible token (“NFT”) using Blockchain Technology and issued by VeFam. The NFT ensures the scarcity and authenticity of the Collectible and the transparency of the Services. NFTs on the VeFam platform are minted using a secondary protocol built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain (“Layer 2”) by Starkware. This layer 2 solution allows for a higher processing capacity for transactions and reduces gas fees than minting directly on Ethereum.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Scarcity:</b> Collectibles are classified based on a level of scarcity specified for each issuance. For instance, a Collectible may be Limited, Rare, Super Rare, or Unique, regarding the total number of items offered. The scarcity of a Collectible is guaranteed by the underlying NFT.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Value:</b> Collectibles are the digital equivalent of paper sports trading cards. They are sold without an investment purpose and/or for the purpose of gaining additional value, even if the Collectibles are resold via the Marketplace or through a Third-Party Service or marketplace.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Ownership:</b> When you purchase a Collectible, you become the definitive owner of the underlying NFT (welcome to Web3!), in accordance with these Terms. Except where otherwise explicitly stated to the contrary, you have the right to freely dispose of your Collectible (via sale, loan, donation, transfer, etc. including in the Marketplace or through a Third-Party Service or marketplace).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Collectible Elements and Third-Party Rights:</b> The player image, team branding (including trademarks and jerseys) and other elements figuring in the Collectibles are officially licensed from the relevant third-party rights holder (“Third-Party Collectible Elements”). This may include third-party patent rights, image rights, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world (“Third-Party Rights”).
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>License to Third-Party Rights in Collectible Elements:</b> Subject to compliance with these Terms, you are hereby granted, on a non-exclusive basis, a worldwide license to use, display and transfer the Third-Party Collectible Elements associated with the Collectibles incorporated into the NFTs that you legitimately own for the period that you own the relevant NFT(s), for personal and non-commercial purposes only. For the avoidance of doubt, you are only authorized to use, display, and transfer Third-Party Collectible Elements as part of the use, display, and transfer (as applicable) of the Collectible embedding such Third-Party Collectible Elements. Any other use, display or transfer of the Third-Party Collectible Elements is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>License Restrictions;</b> You may not, under any circumstances and without VeFam prior written consent, carry out or attempt to carry out any of the following to the Collectibles, whether or not owned by you: (i) use the Collectible and any of the Third-Party Collectible Elements for commercial purposes, advertising or promotion of a third-party product or service; (ii) market merchandise, physical or digital, that represents the purchased Collectible; (iii) alter the image associated with the Collectible, and/or alter, edit or modify the Third-Party Collectible Elements in any other way; (iv) attempt to claim any additional intellectual property rights relating to the Collectible or the Third-Party Collectible Elements; (v) violate any applicable Third-Party Right; and/or (vii) use the Third-Party Collectible Elements and/or the Collectible in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech, defamation or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others, including the image right(s) of the featured player.

  <p class="title">13. Collectible Issuance</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
You can buy a Collectible through auctions on the Website offered by VeFam (at Auction), via posts from other Users (in the Marketplace), or through a third-party marketplace.
    </li>
    <li>
When Collectibles are first issued, we offer them for sale at auction (“Auction”). You and other Users may bid up from the floor price that is initially set. The last, highest bidder acquires the Collectible. There is no reservation price. The Auction for the relevant Collectible will be open for a specified period of time (the “Auction Period”). This may include single Collectibles and Collectible bundles. If you buy a bundle, the included individual Collectibles will be specified.
    </li>
    <li>
Any bid registered on the Website through a User account is deemed authentic and valid. Once you have placed a bid, it cannot be withdrawn or modified. If the Auction Period concludes and your bid is the highest, your payment method will be charged.
    </li>
    <li>
In the event of a service interruption or technical problem that is unforeseeable and/or outside of our reasonable control that causes an Auction to be inaccessible for any period of time within four (4) hours of its scheduled end, VeFam reserves the right to extend the auction period or to cancel the Auction and relaunch it at a later date.
    </li>
    <li>
Consumers generally have a right of withdrawal that can be exercised within fourteen (14) days after the conclusion of the contract pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 221-18 of the French Consumer Code. This means that the consumer can change their mind about a purchase of an item after buying it within 14 days of the purchase and return it to the company they bought it from. Given the digital nature of the Collectibles and the immediate access to the Collectibles by the User after purchase, you will be asked to waive your right to the withdrawal period when purchasing a Collectible, meaning that the Collectible is yours immediately upon purchase and you waive the ability to return it to VeFam for a refund.
By purchasing a collectible on the website, you shall expressly consent to the performance of the contract to begin before the end of the withdrawal period and acknowledge that you will lose your right of withdrawal. We will confirm your agreement to the provision of the digital content and your waiver of your right of withdrawal by email
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer and exchange:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Through the marketplace:</b> You may sell your collectibles to other users or buy other users’ collectibles via posting the relevant collectible on the VeFam marketplace (“marketplace”). Use of the marketplace is governed by the VeFam marketplace terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Through a third-party service:</b> you may withdraw your collectibles from your user account and transfer to and/or sell the collectibles through a third-party service or marketplace. In order to transfer your collectibles to an external wallet or third-party service or marketplace, you will need to pay the gas fees associated with transferring the collectibles from our layer 2 solution to the ethereum blockchain. Any sales or exchanges on third-party services and/or marketplaces will be subject to the terms and conditions provided by such third-party service or marketplace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Disclaimer:</b> to the extent allowed by applicable law, VeFam is under no circumstances responsible or liable for any loss or damage that may occur during the transfer, withdrawal, sale, or exchange of collectibles through the marketplace or outside the website.

  <p class="title">22. Fee and payment</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Any purchases from the site or marketplace will be done through smart contracts on a blockchain using a blockchain wallet. Any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Blockchain via a wallet. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Site and/or the App or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the blockchains,
    </li>
    <li>
      Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.
    </li>
    <li>
      In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 4.25% of the total value of that transaction (each, a “Commission”). You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ronin Network as a part of the transaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Between us , you will be solely responsible for the payment of any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties and assessments (except taxes on net income us) now or hereafter required or imposed by any government agency (collectively, “Taxes”) in connection with your use of the Application (including, without limitation, any any Taxes that may be owed by you owning, transferring or breeding any of your Axes).
      With the exception of income tax levied on VeFarm, you:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Will pay or reimburse us all national, federal, state, local or other taxes of any jurisdiction, including value added tax and duties required by international treaties, customs or other import and export taxes and the amount levied on their behalf based on charges, services rendered or payments hereinafter, may now or hereafter be imposed under the jurisdiction of any national, state, local or any other country with taxing jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          There shall be no right to deduct the amount of any such tax, duty or assessment from payments to us in connection with these Terms.

  <p class="title">23. Risk assessment</p>
  You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The price of blockchain assets is extremely volatile.
      Movements in the prices of other digital assets can severely and adversely affect the value of your NFT,s which can also be subject to significant price fluctuations.
      We cannot guarantee that any NFTs buyer will not lose money.
    </li>
    <li>
      You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFTs-related transactions.
      VeFarm is not responsible for determining the taxes applicable to your transactions on the App, Website or Smart Contract.
    </li>
    <li>
      The application does not store, send or receive NFTs.
      This is because the NFTs only exists thanks to a record of ownership maintained on the App's supporting blockchain on the Ronin network.
      All NFTs transfers occur only on the Ronin network.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are risks associated with the use of Internet-based currencies, including, but not limited to, risks of hardware, software and Internet connections, risks of the introduction of malware and the risk that third parties may gain unauthorized access to the information stored in your wallet.
      You accept and acknowledge that VeFarm will not be responsible for any communication errors, interruptions, errors, distortions or delays that you may experience while using the Ronin network, however caused.
    </li>
    <li>
      A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the VeFarm ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of NFTs.
    </li>
    <li>
      The regulatory mechanism governing blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain and new regulations or policies may adversely affect the development of the VeFarm ecosystem and, therefore, convenience.
      VeFarm potential utility or value.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upgrading of Sky Mavis to the Ronin Network may have unintended, adverse effects on all VeFarm properties.
